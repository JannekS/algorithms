# About
This is an educational project that I pursue in order to deepen my knowledge about vue3, tailwindcss and algorithms.
It starts with a focus on sorting algorithms but will be broadened to searching algorithms and maybe others in the future.
It is based on some great tutorials I drew inspiration from, that will be listed here a bit later on.

# Install
Once you cloned or downloaded the repository run
`npm install` and `npm run dev` and then visit the localhost adress shown in the terminal with your favourite browser.
